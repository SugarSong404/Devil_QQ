# Devil_QQ
A Java program that imitates the login interface of Tencent QQ. When a user logs in, their account information will be encrypted using BASE64 and saved to a specific folder on their computer. The program will be unable to open after multiple logins to avoid detection.
Still need to learn and improve to create dynamic effects for the login box.
